# About the Task
It was my first time to work with NetCode for GameObject yet i was able to figure out thing within 48 hours thats the approximate time i spent on the assignment.

Complete 4 of 5 points as mentioned in the pdf sent over the mail.

5 points was of csv and metadata.
If you check the project file and run in editor i have completed the downloading of csv data using WebRequest and can also load in console the data.
Issue was i didnt understand what data i have to show and where, and also the csv is not correctly formatted for specific data to show.
